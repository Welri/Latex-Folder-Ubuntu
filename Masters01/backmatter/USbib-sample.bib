	abstract = {Coverage path planning consists of finding the route which covers every point of a certain area of interest. In recent times, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been employed in several application domains involving terrain coverage, such as surveillance, smart farming, photogrammetry, disaster management, civil security, and wildfire tracking, among others. This paper aims to explore and analyze the existing studies in the literature related to the different approaches employed in coverage path planning problems, especially those using UAVs. We address simple geometric flight patterns and more complex grid-based solutions considering full and partial information about the area of interest. The surveyed coverage approaches are classified according to a classical taxonomy, such as no decomposition, exact cellular decomposition, and approximate cellular decomposition. This review also contemplates different shapes of the area of interest, such as rectangular, concave and convex polygons. The performance metrics usually applied to evaluate the success of the coverage missions are also presented.},

@article{Guerrero2013,
	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the structure inspection problem using a miniature unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The influence of the wind on the UAV behavior and onboard energy limitations are important parameters that must be taken into account in the structure inspection problem. To tackle these problems, we derive three methods to inspect a structure. First, we develop a Zermelo-Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) method to compute the optimal route to inspect a simple virtual structure. Second, we derive a method that combines meshing techniques with the Zermelo-TSP method. In this approach, the inspection coordinates for the interest points are obtained automatically by means of a meshing algorithm, then, the Zermelo-TSP method is used to compute the time-optimal route to inspect all the interest points in minimal time. Finally, we derive a method for structure inspection based on the Zermelo-Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). These methods have been validated in a simulated environment. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2012.},

@article{Lottes2017,
	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other robots in smart farming applications offer the potential to monitor farm land on a per-plant basis, which in turn can reduce the amount of herbicides and pesticides that must be applied. A central information for the farmer as well as for autonomous agriculture robots is the knowledge about the type and distribution of the weeds in the field. In this regard, UAVs offer excellent survey capabilities at low cost. In this paper, we address the problem of detecting value crops such as sugar beets as well as typical weeds using a camera installed on a light-weight UAV. We propose a system that performs vegetation detection, plant-tailored feature extraction, and classification to obtain an estimate of the distribution of crops and weeds in the field. We implemented and evaluated our system using UAVs on two farms, one in Germany and one in Switzerland and demonstrate that our approach allows for analyzing the field and classifying individual plants.},

The paper presents the different components of the AWARE platform and the scenario in which the multi-UAV missions were carried out. The missions described in this paper include surveillance with multiple UAVs, sensor deployment and fire threat confirmation. In order to avoid redundancies, instead of describing the operation of the full architecture for every mission, only non-overlapping aspects are highlighted in each one. Key issues in multi-UAV systems such as distributed task allocation, conflict resolution and plan refining are solved in the execution of the missions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

@article{Chang2017,
	abstract = {In this paper, we design and build a power line inspection robot capable of hybrid operation modes. Specifically, the developed robot is able to land on the overhead ground wire (OGW) and to move as the climbing robot. When to negotiate obstacles, it can vertically take off the wire and fly over the obstacles as the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A customized trumpet-shaped undercarriage is used to guarantee that the robot can land and move safely. With the aid of a swingable 2D Laser Range Finder (LRF), the robot can not only determine whether there are obstacles but also detect the position and orientation of the OGW, making it suitable for automatic inspection of power lines. The outdoor experimental results1 demonstrate the effectiveness of the robot in landing and obstacle negotiation. In addition, the average power consumption of the robot is much lower than that of traditional flying robots for power line inspection.},

@article{Pham2017,
	abstract = {Wild-land fire fighting is a hazardous job. A key task for firefighters is to observe the 'fire front' to chart the progress of the fire and areas it will likely spread next. Lack of information of the fire front causes many accidents. Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to cover wildfire is promising because it can replace humans for fire tracking, reducing hazards and saving operation costs. In this paper we propose a distributed control framework designed for a team of UAVs that can closely monitor a wildfire in open space, and precisely track its development. The UAV team, designed for flexible deployment, can effectively avoid in-flight collisions and cooperate well with neighbors. They can maintain a certain height level to the ground for safe flight above fire. Experimental results are conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the UAV team in covering a spreading wildfire.},

@article{Choset2001,
	abstract = {This paper surveys recent results in coverage path planning, a new path planning approach that determines a path for a robot to pass over all points in its free space. Unlike conventional point-to-point path planning, coverage path planning enables applications such as robotic demining, snow removal, lawn mowing, car-body painting, machine milling, etc. This paper will focus on coverage path planning algorithms for mobile robots constrained to operate in the plane. These algorithms can be classified as either heuristic or complete. It is our conjecture that most complete algorithms use an exact cellular decomposition, either explicitly or implicitly, to achieve coverage. Therefore, this paper organizes the coverage algorithms into four categories: heuristic, approximate, partial-approximate and exact cellular decompositions. The final section describes some provably complete multi-robot coverage algorithms.},
