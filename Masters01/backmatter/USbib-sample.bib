In recent times, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been employed in several application domains involving terrain coverage, such as surveillance, smart farming, photogrammetry, disaster management, civil security, and wildfire tracking, among others. This paper aims to explore and analyze the existing studies in the literature related to the different approaches employed in coverage path planning problems, especially those using UAVs. We address simple geometric flight patterns and more complex grid-based solutions considering full and partial information about the area of interest. The surveyed coverage approaches are classified according to a classical taxonomy, such as no decomposition, exact cellular decomposition, and approximate cellular decomposition. This review also contemplates different shapes of the area of interest, such as rectangular, concave and convex polygons. The performance metrics usually applied to evaluate the success of the coverage missions are also presented.},

This task is integral to many robotic applications, such as vacuum cleaning robots, painter robots, autonomous underwater vehicles creating image mosaics, demining robots, lawn mowers, automated harvesters, window cleaners and inspection of complex structures, just to name a few. A considerable body of research has addressed the CPP problem. However, no updated surveys on CPP reflecting recent advances in the field have been presented in the past ten years. In this paper, we present a review of the most successful CPP methods, focusing on the achievements made in the past decade. Furthermore, we discuss reported field applications of the described CPP methods. This work aims to become a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in CPP. Likewise, this work aims to present a comprehensive review of the recent breakthroughs in the field, providing links to the most interesting and successful works. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Each cell in the boustrophedon is covered with simple back and forth motions. Once each cell is covered, then the entire environment is covered. Therefore, coverage is reduced to finding an exhaustive path through a graph which represents the adjacency relationships of the cells in the boustrophedon decomposition.

These structures have been widely used for path planning between two points, but can be used for mapping and coverage of robot free spaces. In this paper, we define exact cellular decompositions where critical points of Morse functions indicate the location of cell boundaries. Morse functions are those whose critical points are non-degenerate. Between critical points, the structure of a space is effectively the same, so simple control strategies to achieve tasks, such as coverage, are feasible within each cell. In this paper, we derive a general framework for defining decompositions in terms of critical points and then give examples, each corresponding to a different task.

The influence of the wind on the UAV behavior and onboard energy limitations are important parameters that must be taken into account in the structure inspection problem. To tackle these problems, we derive three methods to inspect a structure. First, we develop a Zermelo-Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) method to compute the optimal route to inspect a simple virtual structure. Second, we derive a method that combines meshing techniques with the Zermelo-TSP method. In this approach, the inspection coordinates for the interest points are obtained automatically by means of a meshing algorithm, then, the Zermelo-TSP method is used to compute the time-optimal route to inspect all the interest points in minimal time. Finally, we derive a method for structure inspection based on the Zermelo-Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). These methods have been validated in a simulated environment. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2012.},

In this regard, UAVs offer excellent survey capabilities at low cost. In this paper, we address the problem of detecting value crops such as sugar beets as well as typical weeds using a camera installed on a light-weight UAV. We propose a system that performs vegetation detection, plant-tailored feature extraction, and classification to obtain an estimate of the distribution of crops and weeds in the field.

A customized trumpet-shaped undercarriage is used to guarantee that the robot can land and move safely. With the aid of a swingable 2D Laser Range Finder (LRF), the robot can not only determine whether there are obstacles but also detect the position and orientation of the OGW, making it suitable for automatic inspection of power lines. The outdoor experimental results1 demonstrate the effectiveness of the robot in landing and obstacle negotiation.

These algorithms can be classified as either heuristic or complete. It is our conjecture that most complete algorithms use an exact cellular decomposition, either explicitly or implicitly, to achieve coverage. Therefore, this paper organizes the coverage algorithms into four categories: heuristic, approximate, partial-approximate and exact cellular decompositions.

	abstract = {Field operations should be done in a manner that minimizes time and travels over the field surface. Automated and intelligent path planning can help to find the best coverage path so that costs of various field operations can be minimized. The algorithms for generating an optimized field coverage pattern for a given 2D field has been investigated and reported. However, a great proportion of farms have rolling terrains, which have a considerable influence on the design of coverage paths. Coverage path planning in 3D space has a great potential to further optimize field operations and provide more precise navigation. Supplementary to that, energy consumption models were invoked taking into account terrain inclinations in order to provide the optimal driving direction for traversing the parallel field-work tracks and the optimal sequence for handling these tracks under the criterion of minimizing direct energy requirements. The reduced energy requirements and consequently the reduced emissions of atmospheric pollutants, e.g. CO2 and NO, are of major concern due to their contribution to the greenhouse effect. Based on the results from two case study fields, it was shown that the reduction in the energy requirements when the driving angle is optimized by taking into account the 3D field terrain was 6.5 % as an average for all the examined scenarios compared to the case when the applied driving angle is optimized assuming even field terrain. Additional reduction is achieved when sequence of field tracks is optimized by taking into account inclinations for driving up and down steep hills. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.},

@article{Atkar2005,
	abstract = {In spray painting applications, it is essential to generate a spray gun trajectory such that the entire surface is completely covered and receives an acceptably uniform layer of paint deposition; we call this the "uniform coverage" problem. The uniform coverage problem is challenging because the atomizer emits a non-trivial paint distribution, thus making the relationships between the spray gun trajectory and the deposition uniformity complex. To understand the key issues involved in uniform coverage, we consider surface patches that are geodesically convex and topologically simple as representative of subsets of realistic automotive surfaces. In addition to ensuring uniform paint deposition on the surface, our goal is to also minimize the associated process cycle time and paint waste. Based on the relationships between the spray gun trajectory and the output characteristics (i.e., uniformity, cycle time and paint waste), our approach decomposes the coverage trajectory generation problem into three subproblems: (1) selecting a seed curve, (2) determining a speed profile along each pass, and (3) selecting the spacing between successive passes. Using concepts such as area magnification and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem from differential geometry, as well as standard optimization procedures, we present procedures to solve each subproblem independently from the others. We demonstrate our trajectory planning procedures by approximating real automotive surfaces by simple surfaces in simulation, and finally evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms experimentally on real automotive surfaces. {\textcopyright} 2005 SAGE Publications.},

@article{Arkin1999,
	abstract = {We study the problem of finding shortest tours/paths for "lawn mowing" and "milling" problems: Given a region in the plane, and given the shape of a "cutter" (typically, a circle or a square), find a shortest tour/path for the cutter such that every point within the region is covered by the cutter at some position along the tour/path. In the milling version of the problem, the cutter is constrained to stay within the region. The milling problem arises naturally in the area of automatic tool path generation for NC pocket machining. The lawn mowing problem arises in optical inspection, spray painting, and optimal search planning. Both problems are NP-hard in general. We give efficient constant-factor approximation algorithms for both problems. In particular, we give a (3+$\epsilon$)-approximation algorithm for the lawn mowing problem and a 2.5-approximation algorithm for the milling problem. Furthermore, we give a simple 65-approximation algorithm for the TSP problem in simple grid graphs, which leads to an 115-approximation algorithm for milling simple rectilinear polygons. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {We present several new contributions in sampling-based coverage path planning, the task of finding feasible paths that give 100% sensor coverage of complex structures in obstacle-filled and visually occluded environments. First, we establish a framework for analyzing the probabilistic completeness of a sampling-based coverage algorithm, and derive results on the completeness and convergence of existing algorithms. Second, we introduce a new algorithm for the iterative improvement of a feasible coverage path; this relies on a sampling-based subroutine that makes asymptotically optimal local improvements to a feasible coverage path based on a strong generalization of the RRT* algorithm. We then apply the algorithm to the real-world task of autonomous in-water ship hull inspection. We use our improvement algorithm in conjunction with redundant roadmap coverage planning algorithm to produce paths that cover complex 3D environments with unprecedented efficiency.

@article{DARP2017,
	abstract = {This paper deals with the path planning problem of a team of mobile robots, in order to cover an area of interest, with prior-defined obstacles. For the single robot case, also known as single robot coverage path planning (CPP), an (n) optimal methodology has already been proposed and evaluated in the literature, where n is the grid size. The majority of existing algorithms for the multi robot case (mCPP), utilize the aforementioned algorithm. Due to the complexity, however, of the mCPP, the best the existing mCPP algorithms can perform is at most 16 times the optimal solution, in terms of time needed for the robot team to accomplish the coverage task, while the time required for calculating the solution is polynomial. In the present paper, we propose a new algorithm which converges to the optimal solution, at least in cases where one exists. The proposed technique transforms the original integer programming problem (mCPP) into several single-robot problems (CPP), the solutions of which constitute the optimal mCPP solution, alleviating the original mCPP explosive combinatorial complexity. Although it is not possible to analytically derive bounds regarding the complexity of the proposed algorithm, extensive numerical analysis indicates that the complexity is bounded by polynomial curves for practical sized inputs. In the heart of the proposed approach lies the DARP algorithm, which divides the terrain into a number of equal areas each corresponding to a specific robot, so as to guarantee complete coverage, non-backtracking solution, minimum coverage path, while at the same time does not need any preparatory stage (video demonstration and standalone application are available on-line http://tinyurl.com/DARP-app).},

The application is based on the deployment of a team of unmanned aerial vehicles that are able to take georeferenced pictures in order to create a full map by applying mosaicking procedures for postprocessing. The main contribution of this work is practical experimentation with an integrated tool. Contributions in different fields are also reported. Among them is a new one-phase automatic task partitioning manager, which is based on negotiation among the aerial vehicles, considering their state and capabilities. Once the individual tasks are assigned, an optimal path planning algorithm is in charge of determining the best path for each vehicle to follow. Also, a robust flight control based on the use of a control law that improves the maneuverability of the quadrotors has been designed. A set of field tests was performed in order to analyze all the capabilities of the system, from task negotiations to final performance. These experiments also allowed testing control robustness under different weather conditions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {We present several new contributions in sampling-based coverage path planning, the task of finding feasible paths that give 100% sensor coverage of complex structures in obstacle-filled and visually occluded environments. First, we establish a framework for analyzing the probabilistic completeness of a sampling-based coverage algorithm, and derive results on the completeness and convergence of existing algorithms. Second, we introduce a new algorithm for the iterative improvement of a feasible coverage path; this relies on a sampling-based subroutine that makes asymptotically optimal local improvements to a feasible coverage path based on a strong generalization of the RRT* algorithm. We then apply the algorithm to the real-world task of autonomous in-water ship hull inspection. We use our improvement algorithm in conjunction with redundant roadmap coverage planning algorithm to produce paths that cover complex 3D environments with unprecedented efficiency.

@article{Danner2000,
	abstract = {This paper addresses the following inspection problem: given a known workspace and a robot with vision capabilities compute a short path path for the robot such that each point on boundary of the workspace is visible from some point on the path. Autonomous inspection, such as by a flying camera, or a virtual reality architectural walkthrough, could be guided by a solution to the above inspection problem. Visibility constraints on both maximum viewing distance and maximum angle of incidence are considered to better model real sensors. An algorithm is presented for planar workspaces which operates in two steps: selecting art gallery-style guards and connecting them to form an inspection path. Experimental results for this algorithm are discussed. Next, the algorithm is extended to three dimensions and inspection paths are shown.},

@article{Englot2011,
	abstract = {The aim of this work is fast, automated planning of robotic inspections involving complex 3D structures. A model comprised of discrete geometric primitives is provided as input, and a feasible robot inspection path is produced as output. Our algorithm is intended for tasks in which 2.5D algorithms, which divide an inspection into multiple 2D slices, and segmentation-based approaches, which divide a structure into simpler components, are unsuitable. This degree of 3D complexity has been introduced by the application of autonomous in-water ship hull inspection; protruding structures at the stern (propellers, shafts, and rudders) are positioned in close proximity to one another and to the hull, and clearance is an issue for a mobile robot. A global, sampling-based approach is adopted, in which all the structures are simultaneously considered in planning a path. First, the state space of the robot is discretized by constructing a roadmap of feasible states; construction ceases when each primitive is observed by a specified number of states. Once a roadmap is produced, the set cover problem and traveling salesman problem are approximated in sequence to build a feasible inspection tour. We analyze the performance of this procedure in solving one of the most complex inspection planning tasks to date, covering the stern of a large naval ship, using an a priori triangle mesh model obtained from real sonar data and comprised of 100,000 primitives. Our algorithm generates paths on a par with dual sampling, with reduced computational effort.},
