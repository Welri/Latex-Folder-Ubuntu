	abstract = {Coverage path planning consists of finding the route which covers every point of a certain area of interest. In recent times, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been employed in several application domains involving terrain coverage, such as surveillance, smart farming, photogrammetry, disaster management, civil security, and wildfire tracking, among others. This paper aims to explore and analyze the existing studies in the literature related to the different approaches employed in coverage path planning problems, especially those using UAVs. We address simple geometric flight patterns and more complex grid-based solutions considering full and partial information about the area of interest. The surveyed coverage approaches are classified according to a classical taxonomy, such as no decomposition, exact cellular decomposition, and approximate cellular decomposition. This review also contemplates different shapes of the area of interest, such as rectangular, concave and convex polygons. The performance metrics usually applied to evaluate the success of the coverage missions are also presented.},

	abstract = {Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is the task of determining a path that passes over all points of an area or volume of interest while avoiding obstacles. This task is integral to many robotic applications, such as vacuum cleaning robots, painter robots, autonomous underwater vehicles creating image mosaics, demining robots, lawn mowers, automated harvesters, window cleaners and inspection of complex structures, just to name a few. A considerable body of research has addressed the CPP problem. However, no updated surveys on CPP reflecting recent advances in the field have been presented in the past ten years. In this paper, we present a review of the most successful CPP methods, focusing on the achievements made in the past decade. Furthermore, we discuss reported field applications of the described CPP methods. This work aims to become a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in CPP. Likewise, this work aims to present a comprehensive review of the recent breakthroughs in the field, providing links to the most interesting and successful works. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The influence of the wind on the UAV behavior and onboard energy limitations are important parameters that must be taken into account in the structure inspection problem. To tackle these problems, we derive three methods to inspect a structure. First, we develop a Zermelo-Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) method to compute the optimal route to inspect a simple virtual structure. Second, we derive a method that combines meshing techniques with the Zermelo-TSP method. In this approach, the inspection coordinates for the interest points are obtained automatically by means of a meshing algorithm, then, the Zermelo-TSP method is used to compute the time-optimal route to inspect all the interest points in minimal time. Finally, we derive a method for structure inspection based on the Zermelo-Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). These methods have been validated in a simulated environment. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2012.},

In this regard, UAVs offer excellent survey capabilities at low cost. In this paper, we address the problem of detecting value crops such as sugar beets as well as typical weeds using a camera installed on a light-weight UAV. We propose a system that performs vegetation detection, plant-tailored feature extraction, and classification to obtain an estimate of the distribution of crops and weeds in the field.

Specifically, the developed robot is able to land on the overhead ground wire (OGW) and to move as the climbing robot. When to negotiate obstacles, it can vertically take off the wire and fly over the obstacles as the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A customized trumpet-shaped undercarriage is used to guarantee that the robot can land and move safely. With the aid of a swingable 2D Laser Range Finder (LRF), the robot can not only determine whether there are obstacles but also detect the position and orientation of the OGW, making it suitable for automatic inspection of power lines. The outdoor experimental results1 demonstrate the effectiveness of the robot in landing and obstacle negotiation. In addition, the average power consumption of the robot is much lower than that of traditional flying robots for power line inspection.},

Lack of information of the fire front causes many accidents. Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to cover wildfire is promising because it can replace humans for fire tracking, reducing hazards and saving operation costs. In this paper we propose a distributed control framework designed for a team of UAVs that can closely monitor a wildfire in open space, and precisely track its development. The UAV team, designed for flexible deployment, can effectively avoid in-flight collisions and cooperate well with neighbors. They can maintain a certain height level to the ground for safe flight above fire. Experimental results are conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the UAV team in covering a spreading wildfire.},

Unlike conventional point-to-point path planning, coverage path planning enables applications such as robotic demining, snow removal, lawn mowing, car-body painting, machine milling, etc. This paper will focus on coverage path planning algorithms for mobile robots constrained to operate in the plane. These algorithms can be classified as either heuristic or complete. It is our conjecture that most complete algorithms use an exact cellular decomposition, either explicitly or implicitly, to achieve coverage. Therefore, this paper organizes the coverage algorithms into four categories: heuristic, approximate, partial-approximate and exact cellular decompositions. The final section describes some provably complete multi-robot coverage algorithms.},

	abstract = {Field operations should be done in a manner that minimizes time and travels over the field surface. Automated and intelligent path planning can help to find the best coverage path so that costs of various field operations can be minimized. The algorithms for generating an optimized field coverage pattern for a given 2D field has been investigated and reported. However, a great proportion of farms have rolling terrains, which have a considerable influence on the design of coverage paths. Coverage path planning in 3D space has a great potential to further optimize field operations and provide more precise navigation. Supplementary to that, energy consumption models were invoked taking into account terrain inclinations in order to provide the optimal driving direction for traversing the parallel field-work tracks and the optimal sequence for handling these tracks under the criterion of minimizing direct energy requirements. The reduced energy requirements and consequently the reduced emissions of atmospheric pollutants, e.g. CO2 and NO, are of major concern due to their contribution to the greenhouse effect. Based on the results from two case study fields, it was shown that the reduction in the energy requirements when the driving angle is optimized by taking into account the 3D field terrain was 6.5 % as an average for all the examined scenarios compared to the case when the applied driving angle is optimized assuming even field terrain. Additional reduction is achieved when sequence of field tracks is optimized by taking into account inclinations for driving up and down steep hills. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.},

@article{Atkar2005,
	abstract = {In spray painting applications, it is essential to generate a spray gun trajectory such that the entire surface is completely covered and receives an acceptably uniform layer of paint deposition; we call this the "uniform coverage" problem. The uniform coverage problem is challenging because the atomizer emits a non-trivial paint distribution, thus making the relationships between the spray gun trajectory and the deposition uniformity complex. To understand the key issues involved in uniform coverage, we consider surface patches that are geodesically convex and topologically simple as representative of subsets of realistic automotive surfaces. In addition to ensuring uniform paint deposition on the surface, our goal is to also minimize the associated process cycle time and paint waste. Based on the relationships between the spray gun trajectory and the output characteristics (i.e., uniformity, cycle time and paint waste), our approach decomposes the coverage trajectory generation problem into three subproblems: (1) selecting a seed curve, (2) determining a speed profile along each pass, and (3) selecting the spacing between successive passes. Using concepts such as area magnification and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem from differential geometry, as well as standard optimization procedures, we present procedures to solve each subproblem independently from the others. We demonstrate our trajectory planning procedures by approximating real automotive surfaces by simple surfaces in simulation, and finally evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms experimentally on real automotive surfaces. {\textcopyright} 2005 SAGE Publications.},

In the milling version of the problem, the cutter is constrained to stay within the region. The milling problem arises naturally in the area of automatic tool path generation for NC pocket machining. The lawn mowing problem arises in optical inspection, spray painting, and optimal search planning. Both problems are NP-hard in general.

In particular, we give a (3+$\epsilon$)-approximation algorithm for the lawn mowing problem and a 2.5-approximation algorithm for the milling problem. Furthermore, we give a simple 65-approximation algorithm for the TSP problem in simple grid graphs, which leads to an 115-approximation algorithm for milling simple rectilinear polygons. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Second, we introduce a new algorithm for the iterative improvement of a feasible coverage path; this relies on a sampling-based subroutine that makes asymptotically optimal local improvements to a feasible coverage path based on a strong generalization of the RRT* algorithm. We then apply the algorithm to the real-world task of autonomous in-water ship hull inspection.

@article{DARP2017,
	abstract = {This paper deals with the path planning problem of a team of mobile robots, in order to cover an area of interest, with prior-defined obstacles. For the single robot case, also known as single robot coverage path planning (CPP), an (n) optimal methodology has already been proposed and evaluated in the literature, where n is the grid size. The majority of existing algorithms for the multi robot case (mCPP), utilize the aforementioned algorithm. Due to the complexity, however, of the mCPP, the best the existing mCPP algorithms can perform is at most 16 times the optimal solution, in terms of time needed for the robot team to accomplish the coverage task, while the time required for calculating the solution is polynomial. In the present paper, we propose a new algorithm which converges to the optimal solution, at least in cases where one exists. The proposed technique transforms the original integer programming problem (mCPP) into several single-robot problems (CPP), the solutions of which constitute the optimal mCPP solution, alleviating the original mCPP explosive combinatorial complexity. Although it is not possible to analytically derive bounds regarding the complexity of the proposed algorithm, extensive numerical analysis indicates that the complexity is bounded by polynomial curves for practical sized inputs. In the heart of the proposed approach lies the DARP algorithm, which divides the terrain into a number of equal areas each corresponding to a specific robot, so as to guarantee complete coverage, non-backtracking solution, minimum coverage path, while at the same time does not need any preparatory stage (video demonstration and standalone application are available on-line http://tinyurl.com/DARP-app).},
