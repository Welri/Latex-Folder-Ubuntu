% Describe wwhat DARP is
% Explain why divide areas was used and specifically why DARP was chosen.
% Make reference to single-robot CPP for individual area searching
% Mention other forms of divide area algorithms?
% Discuss the shortcomings of the DARP algorithm and how some people have addressed them. That one paper used a method where they exchange cells
