\section{Background}

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a technology that have gained popularity in various applications recently\cite{CPP-Survey-2019}. Context in which UAVs have been applied include, but are not limited to, ...

The scope of this paper looks specifically at the application of UAVs in search and rescue operations. Manually piloted UAVs have already been integrated into search and rescue missions... 

Furthermore, there have been developments in the use of drones to perform automated search and rescue operations. One such example is a project by DroneSAR where they use DJI drones to perform search rescue tasks. Their implementation focuses on the automatic coverage of a manually designated area using a single drone. This implementation is the first of it's kind and has already showed promise in shortening the time it takes to locate victims. Included in their design is imaging and tracking technology to help locate victims in search and rescue operations.

\section{Objectives}

The main objective of this thesis was to develop a coverage path planning algorithm that utilises multiple UAVs to search a known environment. This research is intended to be applicable to search and rescue operations.\linebreak
